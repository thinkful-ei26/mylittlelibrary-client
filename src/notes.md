Make an API call to mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds215172.mlab.com:15172/library-app.
1. from where? somewhere in searchbar.js. results are rendered to search-result.js
2. in searchbar.js
    a. how can i test the general concept of making an api call from searchbar.js? How are you calling mlab from the server? try doing that from the client. no, that's too complicated, there is a whole setup around it, including multiple files, config and the express environment. Instead, stick with the api model (aka github)
    b.
